## Description

Candy Crush Saga is a puzzle game that involves making matches of 3 or more colored candy pieces. Released by King in 2012, it is played by millions around the world.
Players swap candy pieces either horizontally and vertically, and once a match is made, the candy disappears, 
causing the surrounding pieces of candy to fall into the empty spaces.
